"あ" is Japanese letter.

    * あ ...this isn't transformed
    * So,this is not too.(Because this is in "<p>~</p>".)

* あ ...this isn't transformed

    * a
    
    * あ
    
    * a
    
    * あ

* a

* あ

* a

Lines which begin "あ" isn't transcformed to list.

"い", "う", "え" and "お" are Japanese letters.

    * あ
